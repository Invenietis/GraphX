/* Some notes about the main objects and types in this example:
 * 
 * GraphAreaExample - our custom layout panel derived from the base GraphArea class with custom data types. Presented as object named: Area.
 * GraphExample - our custom data graph derived from BidirectionalGraph class using custom data types.
 * DataVertex - our custom vertex data type.
 * DataEdge - our custom edge data type.
 * Zoombox - zoom control object that handles all zooming and interaction stuff. Presented as object named: zoomctrl.
 * 
 * VertexControl - visual vertex object that is responsible for vertex drawing. Can be found in Area.VertexList collection.
