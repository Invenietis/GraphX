GraphX for .NET v1

Project Description
  GraphX for .NET is an advanced graph visualization library based on Graph# algorithmic blueprints that uses WPF for rendering (WinForms interop is also working). I've coded it when i felt that Graph# is outdated and can't be easily enhanced in the means of performance and feature implementation.

  COLLABORATION statement: If you have any improvement or new features coded it will be good to see them posted in Discussions as well as your questions. GraphX is free product opened for collaboration. Share your work with the community! Thanks.
  
  Library depends on:
  
    * QuickGraph
    
    * YAXLib
  
  Library uses partial code from:
    * Graph#
    * WPFExtensions
    * NodeXL
    * Extended WPF Toolkit
    
  Features:

Performance oriented library design to deal with large amount of graph vertices.
Internal support for Graph# algorithms ( FR, KK, ISOM, LinLog, Simple Tree, Simple Circle, Sugiyama, CompoundFDP, FSA/FSAOneWay overlap removal).
Advanced graph edges features:
Support for parametrized edge routing algorithms (SimpleER, EdgeBundling, PathFinder)
Support for dynamic and/or single edge routing calculation (for ex. for dragged vertex)
Edges curving (smoothing) technique that can be applied to any ER algorithm
Dynamic templated edge labels
Easy templating including dashed edges of several types
Edge arrow drawing control
Optional self-looped edges visualization support
Optional parallel edges visualization support between vertices
Easy support for user-defined external layout, overlap removal and edge routing algorithms.
Configurable vertex and edge controls highlighting system based on behaviour mechanics.
Easy vertex dragging support.
Vertex and edge move, delete, add, mouse over animation support with the ability to create custom animations!
Universal graph Save/Load methods using YAXLib interfaces
Graph state saving and loading allows the capture and store in-memory visual and data graphs.
Async algorithm computation support.
Rich usability documentation.

  Additional Features:

Enchanced zoom control experience   
2 different built in zoom controls with fixed bugs and optimized behaviour.
Zoombox support for area selection of the vertices
Zoombox's cool overview window and view state management
Design-time visual preview for all controls.
Optional edge Legend control that helps tracking different edges.
Library showcase example.
